    iOS Safari Voicover Progromatic Focus Bug
  </h1>
  <p>
    There is a bug in iOS voiceover where you cannot programmatically send focus to an element if that element contains
    HTML. This is important becaues on a SPA, when swapping out the content on the page, we need to re-focus the topmost
    element and announce it to the user.
    This issue only occurrs on iOS, Voiceover on MacOS works as expected.
  </p>
  <p>
    The &#x3C;a&#x3E; tags located below the buttons work when you use voice over to click on them. But if you use js to
    click on them they do not set focus to the elements. So a workaround using links is not feasible.
  </p>


  <h3>
    Reproduction Steps
  </h3>
  <p>
    on iOS:
    <ol>
      <li>Turn on voiceover</li>
      <li>Navigate to the buttons</li>
      <li>Click the buttons to focus the divs in voiceover</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>
      Expected Result
    </h3>
    Voiceover focuses on the appropriate div

    <h3>
      Actual Result
    </h3>
    If the div contains html, voiceover will not focus on the appropriate div simmilar to how it works with the links
    below the buttons.
